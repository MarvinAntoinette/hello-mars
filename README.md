Just another tutorial repository

Hi Marsians,

just me typing nonesense stuff into the readme file. I'm sure those windmills will keep them cool. We'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go home. I'm just glad my fat, ugly mama isn't alive to see this day. Guess again.

Oh no! The professor will hit me! But if Zoidberg 'fixes' itâ€¦ then perhaps gifts! Yeah, lots of people did. We'll need to have a look inside you with this camera. This is the worst kind of discrimination: the kind against me!
